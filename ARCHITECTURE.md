## 🔐 Purpose
AEGES is designed to disincentivize the theft, misuse, or unauthorized manipulation of digital assets by introducing a protective architecture layered with AI-powered deterrents and quantum-resistant safeguards.

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 1. Immutable Trace Layer (ITL)
- Tamper-proof log of digital asset origin, transfer, and access.
- Zero-knowledge proofs integrated for privacy-preserving verification.

### 2. AI-Powered Risk Engine (AIRE)
- Continuously assesses behavioral risk and actor intent using explainable ML.
- Integrates into national registries and AML/KYC databases via plugins.

### 3. Quantum-Resistant Contract Vault (QRCV)
- AES-256 + lattice-based encryption securing smart contracts and digital signatures.
- Time-bound access using hardware-based quantum lease tokens.

### 4. FINCEN Quarantine Wallet (Optional)
- Automatically routes suspicious asset flows to a holding contract pending review.
- Configurable by national regulators via API.

## ⚖️ Alignment

AEGES is a response to emerging threats in the tokenized economy. Originally developed to protect Consumer-Earned Tokenized Equities (CETEs) within the People's Autonomous Economy (PAE), it has evolved into a global security layer for digital asset ecosystems.

The system embodies a philosophy of making theft "economically pointless" rather than merely difficult, fundamentally shifting the risk/reward calculus for bad actors.
