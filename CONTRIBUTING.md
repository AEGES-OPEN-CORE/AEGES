## 🔒 Branch Protection Policy

To preserve the trustworthiness and sovereign integrity of AEGES (AI-Enhanced Guardian for Economic Stability), the `main` branch is protected by the following enforced controls:

- ✅ All contributions must be submitted via **Pull Requests (PRs)**
- ✅ Each PR requires **at least one approval** prior to merge
- 🚫 **Direct commits** to `main` are disallowed — including by maintainers
- 🔐 **Force pushes and branch deletions** are strictly prohibited
- 👁️ Bypass privileges are limited to `Repository Admins` and designated `Maintainers` under internal governance protocols

These protections are not just best practices — they are essential for the integrity of AEGES as a sovereign-grade security framework. Every line of code reflects a shared responsibility: to uphold public trust, economic transparency, and institutional resilience against digital threats.

> 🧩 AEGES is designed to operate as critical national infrastructure. Therefore, its development pipeline must be defensible, verifiable, and tamper-resistant by design.

For access requests or protocol-level collaboration, email 📫 [dev@bwrci.org](mailto:dev@bwrci.org).

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful, collaborative, and open-minded.
This is a global mission.

For larger contributions or integrations (e.g. quantum tools or national pilots), email us directly at: `dev@bwrci.org`

Together, we can build a future where theft isn’t prevented — it’s economically pointless.
