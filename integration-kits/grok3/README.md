# AEGES x Grok Integration Kit

This integration kit demonstrates how Grok-enabled AI systems can leverage AEGES (AI-Enhanced Guardian for Economic Stability) to establish protective guardrails and actively disincentivize theft, deception, and manipulation in intelligent digital environments.

## ðŸ”§ Included Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aeges_api_specification.json` | API structure and detailed endpoint descriptions |
| `aeges_mock_implementation.js` | Sample implementation simulating threat detection and mitigation |
| `aeges_integration_examples.js` | Grok integration patterns and behavioral response strategies |
| `README.md` | This guide â€” overview and setup instructions |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** or download the `integration-kits/grok3` directory.
2. Review the `aeges_api_specification.json` to understand core endpoints and threat signatures.
3. Run `aeges_mock_implementation.js` to simulate protective logic in action.
4. Study `aeges_integration_examples.js` to see Grok integration examples in applied contexts.

## ðŸ§  Why This Matters

AEGES redefines protection: instead of just defending against threats, it makes them economically irrational. This kit empowers AI developers and researchers to plug in that logic directly using Grok-based systems or similar frameworks.
