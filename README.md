# AEGES - AI-Enhanced Guardian for Economic Stability

🛡️ **Quantum-Resistant Asset Protection Protocol**

AEGES demonstrates revolutionary economic security through AI-powered behavioral analysis that makes theft economically worthless, even after successful attacks.

> **"We don't prevent theft - we make it economically pointless!"**

## 🎯 The Problem: Traditional Security Fails

When FlashSwap Protocol gets drained:
- **$2.1M stolen** in 47 seconds
- **12,000 investors** affected  
- **Scammer's wallet**: 0x1337...hack
- **Traditional response**: *"Funds are gone. Sorry for your loss."*

## ✅ AEGES Revolutionary Response

**"Theft detected. Economic quarantine activated. Stolen value neutralized."**
